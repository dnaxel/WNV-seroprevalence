# Repository name: WNV-seroprevalence
## Description:
This repository contains datasets and R code related to the analysis presented in the publication titled "Quantifying the West Nile virus circulation in the avian host population in Northern Italy". The publication describes a modelling framework used to estimate the est Nile virus (WNV) incidence in the avian population in the Emilia-Romagna region, which enabled us to eventually assess the fraction of corvids that present anti-WNV antibodies at the end of each epidemiological season.

## Datasets:
1. corvid_data.xlsx: number of corvids that were sampled and tested for WNV RNA in organs in each specific subregion and time point. LATIN_NAME: species; WEEK: sampling occurred in WEEK or WEEK+1; YEAR: year of sampling; SUBREGION: location of the trap; TOTAL: number of sampled corvids; WNV: number of WNV-positive corvids.

# Repository name: WNV-seroprevalence
## Description:
This repository contains datasets and R code related to the analysis presented in the publication titled "Quantifying the West Nile virus circulation in the avian host population in Northern Italy". The publication describes a modelling framework used to estimate the est Nile virus (WNV) incidence in the avian population in the Emilia-Romagna region, which enabled us to eventually assess the fraction of corvids that present anti-WNV antibodies at the end of each epidemiological season.

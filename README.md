# Repository name: WNV-seroprevalence
## Description:
This repository contains datasets and R code related to the analysis presented in the publication titled "Quantifying the West Nile virus circulation in the avian host population in Northern Italy". The publication describes a modelling framework used to estimate the est Nile virus (WNV) incidence in the avian population in the Emilia-Romagna region, which enabled us to eventually assess the fraction of corvids that present anti-WNV antibodies at the end of each epidemiological season.

## Datasets:
1. corvid_data.xlsx: number of corvids that were sampled and tested for WNV RNA in organs in each specific subregion and time point. LATIN_NAME: species; WEEK: sampling occurred in WEEK or WEEK+1; YEAR: year of sampling; SUBREGION: location of the trap; TOTAL: number of sampled corvids; WNV: number of WNV-positive corvids.  
2. corvids_towns.xlsx: number of corvids sampled in each municipality from 2013 to 2022. TOWN: municipality; TOTAL: number of sampled corvids; WNV: number of WNV-positive corvids; INCIDENCE: WNV/TOTAL; id: unique code assigned to each municipality; long - lat: longitude and latitude of the municipality's centroid; PROVINCE: province of the municipality; SUBREGION: subregion containing the municipality.
3. mosquito_data.xlsx: number of mosquito pools tested for WNV RNA presence. WEEK: sampling occurred in WEEK or WEEK+1; YEAR: year of sampling; WNV: number of WNV-positive pools; TOTAL: number of sampled pools.
4. serology_data.xlsx: number of corvids, sampled in subregion 2, that were tested for WNV antibody presence. WEEK: sampling occurred in WEEK or WEEK+1; YEAR: year of sampling; TOTAL: number of sampled corvids; IMMUNE: number of corvids classified positive for anti-WNV presence in serum.
